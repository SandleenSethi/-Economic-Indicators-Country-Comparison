# Economic Indicators & Country Comparison Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard that analyzes macroeconomic indicators across multiple countries, with a focus on Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. The dashboard examines how GDP, inflation, and school enrollment have evolved over time and how these indicators relate to economic and educational development.

Data was retrieved using the World Bank API and visualized using Power BI to uncover patterns in regional development, inflation volatility, and education performance.

---

## Objectives

- Track and compare GDP growth from 2000 to 2022.
- Analyze inflation trends and identify key spikes.
- Evaluate school enrollment in relation to GDP.
- Summarize the latest available year’s key performance metrics by country.
- Provide insights to support economic policy and planning.

## Tools and Technologies

- Power BI – for building and publishing dashboards  
- Excel – for data cleaning and transformation  
- Python – for retrieving data using public APIs  
- World Bank API – data source for GDP, inflation, and school enrollment

---

## API Integration

Data for this dashboard was collected using Python scripts to connect with the World Bank API. This allowed for automated retrieval and refresh of:

- GDP (current US dollars)  
- Inflation (consumer prices, annual %)  
- School enrollment, secondary (% gross)

The use of an API ensures that the data remains up-to-date and scalable for future analysis.

   Pakistan should focus on improving access to education to close the gap with its regional peers. Bangladesh provides a strong model for effective investment in schooling.

2. **Control Inflation through Fiscal Policy**  
   High inflation in Pakistan and Bangladesh calls for targeted economic reforms to stabilize prices and encourage sustainable growth.

3. **Promote Balanced Economic Growth**  
   Bangladesh’s GDP rise shows promise. Continued investment in infrastructure and industrial growth is necessary to maintain momentum.

4. **Align Economic and Educational Strategies**  
   Encouraging investment in education as part of national economic strategy can drive long-term productivity and human development.
